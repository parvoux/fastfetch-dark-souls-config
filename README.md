config.jsonc should be put in config folder for fastfetch, if you do not have one generate it like it says [here](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch?tab=readme-ov-file#q-where-is-the-config-file-i-cant-find-it).

In the config file edit the source, right at the beggining to the path of the logo.txt on your PC:

logo_big is higher detail but will fuck formatting if your're not running terminal in a rather big window.

normal logo:
